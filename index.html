			<h1>Reduced Lens Community</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Reduced Lens Community, the freely available and open source vision improvement community.</p>
			<div class="links">

			<h1>What's happening?</h1>
			<h2>Reduced Lens Wiki</h2>
			<p>Due to server costs and seeing how people interact with reducedlens.org, the choice has been made to reduce these costs while still preserving as much free content as possible.</p>
			<p>Reduced Lens Wiki saw very very few edits, just like <a href="https://wiki.endmyopia.org/wiki/EndMyopia_Wiki">EndMyopia Wiki</a> for many years, and there ultimately isn't much of a point in keeping a Web 2.0 MediaWiki instance running on a backend that costs money when all the content is effectively already written and all people really want to do is read the content.</p>
			<p>People can either choose to read <a href="https://wiki.endmyopia.org/wiki/EndMyopia_Wiki">EndMyopia Wiki</a> with virtually the same content as Reduced Lens Wiki had, or use the <a href="https://github.com/Reduced-Lens/Reduced-Lens-Wiki-Archive">Reduced Lens Wiki archive</a>.</p>
			<p>For a more modern way to read the most important content of the wiki, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/Reduced-Lens/Reduced-Lens-Book">Reduced Lens Book</a>.</p>
			<h2>Reduced Lens Forum</h2>
			<p>Thanks to everyone who participated in the forum. Ultimately it has to be closed though - the <a href="https://discord.gg/ysGb5paH4a">Discord server</a> will always be around for as long as possible for those interested in talking to other people to get advice.</p>
